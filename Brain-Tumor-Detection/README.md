## About
- This project is a Flask-based web application designed for brain tumor detection. Healthcare professionals can effortlessly upload MRI scans and receive instant results. Our application is not only fast and accurate but also offers a user-friendly interface, powered by cutting-edge deep learning technology.

- This Project was built at [The Actual Open AI HackaThon](https://devfolio.co/the-actually-open-ai-hackathon/dashboard)

## Features

### Model Training and Integration
- Train a brain tumor detection model using a suitable deep learning architecture (e.g., U-Net, CNN).
- Save the trained model weights and architecture for later use.

### Setting Up Flask App
- Create a new directory for your Flask project.
- Set up the basic structure: `static/` for static files (e.g., CSS, images), `templates/` for HTML templates.

### Flask Routing
- Define routes in `app.py` to handle different pages of the web application (e.g., home page, result page).

### HTML Templates
- Create HTML templates in the `templates/` directory. These templates will define the structure of your web pages, including forms for uploading MRI scans.

### File Upload and Processing
- Implement a form in your HTML template to allow users to upload MRI scans.
- In the Flask route that handles form submission, process the uploaded file. This may involve saving the file, preprocessing it for model input, and passing it to the model for prediction.

### Model Inference
- Load the pre-trained model in Flask.
- Use it to make predictions on the uploaded MRI scan.

### Display Results
- Create a separate template to display the results of the tumor detection.

### Styling and User Interface
- Use CSS and other front-end technologies to style your web application and make it user-friendly.

### Integration of Model Output
- Display the model's output on the results page. This could be a binary classification (tumor or no tumor) or a segmentation result.

### Testing and Debugging
- Thoroughly test the application, including edge cases. Use Flask's built-in debugging tools to identify and fix any issues.

### Deployment
- Once your application is working locally, you can deploy it using a platform like Heroku or AWS.

### Documentation and Usage Guide
- Provide clear instructions on how to use the web application, including any dependencies or setup required.
- Remember to handle potential errors gracefully, such as incorrect file types or unexpected inputs.
- Consider adding features like user authentication and security measures to protect sensitive medical data.
- Always respect privacy and data protection regulations when working with medical information.

## Getting Started
To run this application locally, follow these steps:
